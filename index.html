        <p>Board games has long been used as an entertainment for all people in different occasions and situations. There are a lot of board games out there and chess is one of the most famous board games played in different countries. Although there is no history records from who invented chess, but in our ancient times, chess has been played in some countries. My name is Rehaan Kumar. I am 11 years old and study in Grade 6 in Hiranandani Foundation School, Mumbai. I love playing chess and I feel it is the most interesting game ever. Chess is also very beneficial. Playing chess improves brain function because the player uses his or her brain's left hemisphere which deals with recognition of objects, and right hemisphere which deals with recognition of patterns. Playing chess improves memory by adopting the strategies and tactics used for good gaming experience.</p>
